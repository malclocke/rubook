Rubook
======

Rubook allows you to work with Google Contacts from Mutt.

Install
-------

* `gem install contacts hpricot`
* copy `sample_roobook.yml` to `~/.rubook.yml` and edit
* Add `set query_command="/path/to/rubook '%s'"` to `~/.muttrc`

You should now be able to type part of an address or name into the 'To:' field
when composing a message and have it autocomplete from your Google contacts.
