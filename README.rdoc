= Rubook

Rubook allows you to work with Google Contacts from Mutt.

== Install

 # gem install contacts hpricot
 # cp sample_rubook.yml ~/.rubook.yml

Add the following to your ~/.muttrc

 # set query_command="/path/to/rubook '%s'"

You should now be able to type part of an address or name into the 'To:' field
when composing a message and have it autocomplete from your Google contacts.
